{"body":"K?lauea Iki Overlook        K?lauea Iki Overlook NPS Photo       Crater Rim Drive Tour - Stop #5      Continuing along Crater Rim Drive you come to K?lauea Iki Overlook. Alternately, the driver could drive to the Overlook and the rest of the party could walk a 1/2 mile section of the Crater Rim Trail to the Overlook. This is also an option when the Thurston Lava Tube parking area is full. K?lauea Iki looks fairly tranquil these days. But, in 1959 it was a seething lava lake, with lava fountains up to 1,900 feet. From up here it is difficult to comprehend the scale of K?lauea Iki. The crater is a mile long, 3,000 feet across, and the floor is 400 feet below the overlook. This is the trailhead for the 4 mile loop hike around K?lauea Iki.      Go to: Crater Rim Drive Tour - Stop #6 - N?huku : Thurston Lava Tube      Return to: Crater Rim Drive Tour - main page Things to Do","title":"Hawai\u0027i Volcanoes National Park: K?lauea Iki Overlook","url":"https://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/craterrimtour_kilaueaikiovlk.htm"}
