{"body":"Jesuit Church Foundation       The adobe blocks from the original Jesuit church were removed and used in the construction of the present-day Franciscan church at Tumacácori in the early years of the 19th century. However, the rock foundation of the that first church remains intact today and the Park preservation crew maintains an adobe and lime plaster marker on top of it to indicate where the original church once stood.       Photo by Jana Tschopp        Photo by Jana Tschopp        Photo by Jana Tschopp        Photo by Jana Tschopp","title":"Tumacácori National Historical Park: Jesuit Church Foundation","url":"https://www.nps.gov/tuma/learn/historyculture/jesuit-church-foundation.htm"}
