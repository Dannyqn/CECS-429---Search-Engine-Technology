{"body":"Francisco Elías Gonzalez       Francisco Elías Gonzales was a soldier for many years on the northern frontier of New Spain. He started his military career at the Presidio of Janos, where he was married to the captain\u0027s daughter. He served there as a lieutenant under his father-in-law, Diaz del Carpio. When the latter trasferred to the Presidio of Terrenate in 1752, Elías Gonzales went with him and eventually replaced him as that presidio\u0027s captain. He served there for many years and his now externsive posterity owns much of the ranchlands of the Arizona-Sonora border region. To read some of his original letters click (here).
