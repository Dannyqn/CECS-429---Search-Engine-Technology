NPS - Ed Shiinoki  The next stop is the Pu?u Pua?i Overlook. On most days, the strong trade winds make it easy to see how the cone was built during the high lava fountaining in 1959. Notice parts of the old road are buried under Pu?u Pua?i. (Road rebuilding and rerouting is a fact of life here at Hawai?i Volcanoes National Park.) Close to K?lauea Iki?s fountaining, the lava pumice cinders were hot enough to weld themselves together into a spatter cone, Pu?u Pua?i. Pu?u Pua?i means gushing hill. Further downwind, the falling cinders had cooled sufficiently to form a blanket of cinders. The Pu\u0027u Pua\u0027i overlook area is also the upper trailhead for Devastation Trail, which provides a full view of the spatter cone.      Go to: Crater Rim Drive Tour - Stop #8 - Devastation Trail      Return to: Crater Rim Drive Tour - main page Things to Do","title":"Hawai\u0027i Volcanoes National Park: Pu‘u Pua‘i Overlook","url":"https://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/craterrimtour_puupuai.htm"}
