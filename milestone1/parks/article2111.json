After the expulsion of Padre Liberós by the new Mexican government because of his having been born in Spain, Tumacácori never had another resident missionary. Other Franciscans tried to keep the missions opperating by visiting them from a distance, but Guevavi, Sonoitac, and Calabazas were abandoned in that order. Eventually, in December of 1848, Tumacácori was also abandoned.
