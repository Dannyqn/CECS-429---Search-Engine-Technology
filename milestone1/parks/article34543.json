{"body":"General Resource Descriptions              The starting point for preservation of park resources is the development of an understanding of what natural resources are present in a park. Staff members at Shenandoah are in the process of gathering natural history information about the plants, animals, water, geologic, and soils found in the park. They also gather data about the air quality and climate of the park. As this information is developed, it is posted on the web. You can find this information in:   Animals   Plants  Natural Features \u0026 Ecosystems  For detailed descriptions of individual plants and animals goto Species Profiles.","title":"Shenandoah National Park: General Resource Descriptions","url":"https://www.nps.gov/shen/learn/nature/resource_descriptions.htm"}
