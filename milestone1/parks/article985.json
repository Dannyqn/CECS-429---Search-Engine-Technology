In 2012 it had killed ??hi?a trees across about 1000 hectares (nearly 2500 acres.) By the summer of 2014, that number had swelled to over 6000 hectares. Still isolated to the island of Hawai?i, researchers have yet to determine the origin of this virulent strain. Join research plant pathologist Lisa Keith of the Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center, Flint Hughes, Research Ecologist with USDA Forest Service Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry and J.B. Friday, University of Hawai?i College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources as they provide an update on this new threat to Hawaii\u0027s native forests. Research so far has determined that within two to three years of detection, a majority of trees in some measured stands have succumbed to the disease. This means the fungus has the potential to threaten forests statewide, resembling not so much a tree disease as a house on fire. Don\u0027t miss this important opportunity to learn what you can do to help.
