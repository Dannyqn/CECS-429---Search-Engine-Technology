{"body":"A New Bed for Doan Creek        The restored creek travels a new path in a different location from the irrigation ditch it had become. The turquoise line shows the proposed path for the restored channel; notice the large number of curves. Doan Creek will now flow into Mill Creek, which is highlighted with dark blue lines. The red line shows the location of the diverted Doan Creek, a relatively straight irrigation ditch that follows the base of the park\u0027s hill. NPS image        This map is used to orient visitors at the park to the old and \"new\" locations of Doan Creek.
