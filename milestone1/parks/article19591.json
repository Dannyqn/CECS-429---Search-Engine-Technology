{"body":"Partners          Collaborative partnerships with former prisoners of war, such as the \"Victory From Within\" traveling exhibit, have assisted Andersonville in better telling the prisoner of war story. NPS/C. Barr       In recent years, partnerships have become a way to get things done both within and beyond park boundaries. Partnerships foster a shared sense of stewardship. Partners develop appreciation for the park\u0027s values and resources, and a commitment to our mission. Recent partners of Andersonville National Historic Site include the American Ex-Prisoners of War, Friends of Andersonville, Jimmy Carter National Historic Site, Georgia Department of Natural Resources, River Valley Regional Commission, Sumter Cycling, and the National Park Foundation.","title":"Andersonville National Historic Site: Partners","url":"https://www.nps.gov/ande/getinvolved/partners.htm"}
