{"body":"General Management Plan             In 2002, the Tumacácori Unit of the Historical Park was expanded by 310 acres. The new lands include important resources associated with the Mission San Jose de Tumacácori: the mission orchard and acequia, farmlands, and a portion of the Santa Cruz River. Because these new lands were not a part of the park in 1996 when the last general management plan was completed, Tumacácori National Historical Park is working on a new general management plan that will prescribe resource conditions and visitor experiences to be achieved over the next 15 to 20 years.
